### DNS over TLS

DNS over TLS ( DoT ) is a security protocol that encrypts and authenticates all DNS traffic 
to prevent hijacking, eavesdropping and manipulation of its data via man-in-the-middle attacks.
It also offers as an alternative solution to other available protocol such as DNS over HTTP (DoH), DNSSEC, DNSCurve, DNSCrypt, and IPSEC
